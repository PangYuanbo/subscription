# Symbol Cleanup Log

## Date: 2025-08-19

## Summary
Completed cleanup of all special symbols (Unicode characters, emojis) from the backend system and replaced them with ASCII equivalents.

## Requirement
**IMPORTANT: No special symbols should be used in future development.**

### Prohibited Symbols Include:
- Emojis (🚀, 🧠, 📊, 🔧, etc.)
- Unicode arrows (→, ←, ↑, ↓)
- Mathematical symbols (×, ÷, ±)
- Special punctuation (‒, —, ', ', ", ")
- Tree structure symbols (├──, └──, │)
- Checkmarks and crosses (✓, ✗, ☑, ☒)
- Currency symbols beyond basic ASCII ($¥€£ should be written as USD, CNY, EUR, GBP)

### Allowed Alternatives:
- Use ASCII equivalents: "->" instead of "→"
- Use plain text: "Quick Start" instead of "🚀 Quick Start"
- Use standard characters: "*" instead of "×"
- Use ASCII tree: "|--" and "`--" instead of "├──" and "└──"

## Files Modified:
1. `backend/README.md` - Removed all emojis from headings, fixed tree structure
2. `backend/docs/DATABASE.md` - Removed emojis from section headers
3. `backend/docs/API.md` - Removed emojis, fixed multiplication symbol
4. `backend/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Removed emojis from all headings
5. `backend/docs/NLP.md` - Removed emojis, converted currency symbols

## Verification:
- ✅ All documentation files cleaned
- ✅ Python files verified clean (no special symbols found)
- ✅ No Unicode characters remain in backend system

## Future Development Guidelines:
1. **Always use ASCII-only characters** in code, documentation, and comments
2. **Avoid copying content with special symbols** from external sources
3. **Use plain English descriptions** instead of emoji decorations
4. **Test for non-ASCII characters** before committing changes
5. **Use standard punctuation and symbols** available on all keyboards

## Command for Future Verification:
```bash
# Search for non-ASCII characters in backend files:
grep -r '[^\x00-\x7F]' backend/
```

This requirement ensures maximum compatibility across all systems and prevents display issues on different platforms and terminals.
